# UniversalScrobbler (project name pending)

UniversalScrobbler is a personal exploration into reclaiming purpose in music consumption.  
It serves as a centralized backend for tracking and understanding your musical life across analog and digital experiences.

## üéß Why This Project Exists

In an age of streaming algorithms and passive listening, I found myself longing for a more intentional, meaningful way of engaging with music. I collect vinyl records ‚Äî moments, memories, and music that matter ‚Äî but still rely heavily on Spotify or other streaming services while on the go.

This project was born out of a frustration: my analog listening experiences were invisible, while my digital history was cluttered with background noise ‚Äî like Spotify autoplaying into the void on my Hi-Fi when it wasn't even on.

UniversalScrobbler aims to bridge that gap.

## üåç Vision

- **Connect every listening context** ‚Äî whether you're spinning vinyl in your vacation house or streaming a new release on your commute.
- **Bring clarity to consumption** ‚Äî understand *what* you're listening to, *where*, and *why*.
- **Reclaim music as an experience**, not background noise.
- **Use Spotify as an exploration tool**, not a consumption metric.
- **Promote physical ownership** and support for artists through intentional collection.

This is a backend-first project intended to power a suite of tools for scrobbling, insights, and collection discovery ‚Äî all driven by *your actual listening habits* and curated taste.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

UniversalScrobbler is built as a modular, production-grade application with a clear separation of concerns and strong architectural boundaries.

### Backend (FastAPI)

- Built using **FastAPI** and **SQLModel** with **Alembic** for migrations.
- Uses **PostgreSQL** with a normalized schema (3rd normal form) and `UUID` primary keys.
- Models are split into:
  - `sqlmodels/`: database models (`table=True`)
  - `appmodels/`: API-layer models using Pydantic for clean I/O contracts  
    (we never use SQLModel objects directly in REST or between layers).
- Business logic is organized in **service classes**, instantiated as **singletons**.
- App-level dependencies (e.g. `auth`, `database.py`) live in `dependencies/`.
- Custom scripts for background tasks or scheduled jobs live in `/scripts`  
  (but all logic still resides in services and is covered by Poetry).
- Settings handled via **Dynaconf** with `settings.toml` and `secrets.toml`.
- Logging and Dynaconf setup lives in `config.py`.
- Each router has its own file and is registered in `main.py`.

The backend is deployed as a **systemd service** (`uvicorn.service`)

### Frontend (React)

- Built using **React**, **MUI**, and **Context API**.
- Structured into `pages/`, `components/`, and `contexts/`.
- Environment-specific configs live in `.env.development` and `.env.production`.

### Deployment

- Deployed automatically on push to `dev` branch.
- React app is built and served from a folder directly on the hosting server.
- Backend runs separately via `uvicorn` with PostgreSQL as the data layer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Development

This project assumes a working local development environment with Python and Node.js installed.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- A running **PostgreSQL** service
- A new, blank database and a dedicated user
- Add connection info to `secrets.toml` (see `secrets.toml_template`)

### üîß Install & Run

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

#### Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd api
poetry install
```

#### Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd ../ui
npm install
```
#### Start dev servers (backend + frontend concurrently)
```bash
make dev
```

### üß™ Environment Notes
Backend is built with Poetry and uses Dynaconf for config.

Frontend uses npm and MUI, with env configs in .env.*.
